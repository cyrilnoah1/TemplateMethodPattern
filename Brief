The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton
of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to
subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the
algorithmâ€™s structure.

In this example, we prepare different types of Upma
based on the provided ingredients. We make use of the
Template Method pattern to make the preparation process
common for any type of Upma, only change in the ingredients.
